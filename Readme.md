#AUDIO INPUT - VISUALIZER
##By Will Simpson
     
  Thanks to code train and minim library for inspiration and getting me started
     
  Choose an audio input source and change the mixerInfo[] value in line 33
     
  Change the img in loadImage for different background or image or set background as color,
  remember that in order to use an image for background the window must be same size as the image file
